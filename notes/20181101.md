**Next Meeting**

Meetings will be on the first Thursday of the month at 14:00 UTC. We may meet more often as needed approaching releases or big decisions, but that will be the standard meeting date/time.

This is December 6th, and Jonathan may be unable to attend. Could we move this a week later to December 13th?
