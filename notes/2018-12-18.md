**Decisions**

**Discussion**

* Process: The following decisions still need to be made:

> That is about as far as we got according to my notes. Some things I 
> can think of that still need to be decided:
>
> - what is the process for approving and assigning bugs
>
> - what is the process for assigning new features once voted on
>
> - what is the minimum number of YES votes need to accept a new feature 
> or bug
>
> - what is the process for officially opening the voting period for a 
> feature or bug request (i.e. does the clock start when the item is 
> submitted, is there a formal triage process, etc.)
>
>
> Let me know if I've missed anything and whether this is ok to send to 
> the wider list.
