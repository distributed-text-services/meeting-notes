**Action Items**

***From Previous Meeting:***


DONE:

> * For initial setup of the technical committee we should send a mail 
> to the group list to ask people to send a request to join the 
> technical committee.

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/distributed-text-services/r41HgZxgEdU

* ACTION:  Jonathan to write a proposal for the role of the chair.

Here's my first take at it:

> The chair is responsible to run the meetings, create agendas,  ensure that issues are adequately understood before decisions are made, and seek decisions by consensus whenever possible.  The chair also ensures that decisions are adequately recorded and assigns and tracks action items.



OPEN?

* Hugh is assigned to create a draft of the Hydra documentation (per issue https://github.com/distributed-text-services/specifications/issues/139). Emmanuelle and Bridget will review and contribute.


***New Action Items:***

**Decisions**

**Discussion**

* Process: The following decisions still need to be made:

> That is about as far as we got according to my notes. Some things I 
> can think of that still need to be decided:
>
> - what is the process for approving and assigning bugs
>
> - what is the process for assigning new features once voted on
>
> - what is the minimum number of YES votes need to accept a new feature 
> or bug
>
> - what is the process for officially opening the voting period for a 
> feature or bug request (i.e. does the clock start when the item is 
> submitted, is there a formal triage process, etc.)
>
>
> Let me know if I've missed anything and whether this is ok to send to 
> the wider list.


* Issue 138
https://github.com/distributed-text-services/specifications/issues/138

ACTION:  Everyone should make proposals directly in the issue, pointing to any gists or other artifacts needed.

* Extending DTS for write operations

**Next Meeting**

Meetings will be on the first Thursday of the month at 14:00 UTC. We may meet more often as needed approaching releases or big decisions, but that will be the standard meeting date/time.

This is December 6th, and Jonathan may be unable to attend. Could we move this a week later to December 13th?

Decision:  We will meet at 4:15 p.m. French time on December 13th (10:15 ET).
