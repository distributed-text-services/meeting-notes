## Discussion

### Issue #186

Agreed:

* In the navigation API, there is always one parent because we are inside a document
* We will add the `parent` property to the navigation API and examples in the document
* This property is always displayed in the same way as children.

Action 01: Ian will add the `parent` property to the navigation API specification and the examples and submit a pull request that we can approve at the next meeting.

Action 04: Ian will add the `up` link header to the document API specification and the examples and submit a pull request that we can approve at the next meeting.

Note:  For collections, we have `parents`.  These properties have different names, that is intentional.

### Questions for future: references

* Can the children of a document be selected from another document?  Do we need something like entity references in our API?

Action 02: Thibault will create an issue for this

Action 03: Hugh will choose a set of issues to discuss in the next meeting
