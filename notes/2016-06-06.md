**Organizational questions:**

- 07/04 is US holiday: move next meeting to 07/25
- Google group, email for communications
- Google doc for taking minutes, then copy to Github
- Github issues for action items

**Work since last meeting:**

- User stories have been added and categorized
- RADL spec has been translated to new terminology

**Discussion about user stories / use cases:**

- CSV more concrete, issues more abstract
- New user stories have been added to CSV, are they in scope?

**Terminology:**

- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eHH6Pk9TX_p9GaTYfJWyiJz0znovk8iDI8IknmTEhIQ/edit
- Need concrete examples for UC/US!
- US 1:
  - ask the idea entity of a work and get all concrete examples
  - work ID is different from general metadata in that it directly references the work (?)
  - difference between querying for existence of resources vs. actual resources
- US 2:
  - non-empty would be equivalent to boolean true (?)
  - there are cases where receiving just booleans would be preferable
  - Terminology: Version -> Digital Edition
- US 3:
  - Edition -> Version
- US 5:
  - Translation of Edition vs Edition of Translation
  - Sometimes translation are not of individual editions
  - Translations can feedback to editions
  - Why not call it (FRBR-)Manifestation?
  - Difference between Expression/Manifestation/Instance and Edition/Exemplar (?)
  - Recap of terminology discussion:
    - https://github.com/jeffreycwitt/scta-ontology/blob/master/SCTASCHEMA2.pdf
