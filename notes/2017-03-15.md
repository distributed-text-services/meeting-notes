## Summary

All agreed we need a new way of working if we're going to make progress.

Some notes on the discussion are below, but the summary of the decisions are
as follows:

* We are separating the effort into 3 "teams": Collections API, References API and Passage API (names on those last two are still TBD)

* We will have weekly standup meetings (ideally 15 minutes or less) to try to keep momentum going and ensure open issues are resolved

* Next standup meeting on topic of Collections API will be 22 March at 12:00 EST/17:00 CET (note 5 hr difference due to daylight savings in US)

* We have defined roles of team "organizer" and overall project "chair"

   * Bridget will be organizer for Collections API

   * Thibault will be organizer for References API

   * Hugh will be organizer for Passage API

   * Jonathan will be chair

* Organizer responsibilities:

   * keeping track of open issues and action items for their piece

   * reminding people to weigh in on open issues (see below)
  
   * convening weekly stand-up meetings

   * giving 24 hour notice of agendas for standup meetings

   * raising contentious issues needing group consensus to the chair

* Chair responsibilities

   * convening "plenary" meetings of the entire group

   * driving issues needing consenus to resolution

## Discussion Notes

procedures

how to make progress faster

can we have a 2-day hackathon?

issues: timezone, time

weeklong with european pm/us eastern am


1 2 hr meeting per week, maybe with plenary
assign responsibilities

reporting/organizing issues/convening meetings

Organizers (need 2 - 1 for collections API):
- schedule the meetings
- check on issues that are open
- send emails on open issues 24 hours before the meeting
- organizing submeetings for specific questions

Chair
Organizes overall meeting
Talks with people 24 hours before meeting
Determine consensus

Frequent, short stand-ups
But we need a procedure for resolving open issues
And we need people to follow the issues and respond

2 weekly standups of 15 minutes each
Offline decision making process, (with timeouts?)
Reasonable timeframe: 3 weeks?
    At 2 week mark, organizer sends a warning
    At 3 week mark, decision is made, feedback or no

Passage API discussion
 
Separation of metadata and objects?
Reminder DTS effort originated out of dissatisfaction with CTS
CTS calls:
getCapabilities (metadata at level of text)
getPassage (passage)
getValidReff (list of references)

Do we need separate API for retrieving references and the content itself? 
If not separate apis, maybe separate routes
At a minimum, it helps to think about them separately - we may merge all back to a single api in the end

Thibault will lead Reference API  

Hugh will will lead Passage API

Next weekâ€™s standup on Collections API will be on 22 March at 12:00pm EST/17:00 CET (note still 5 hour time difference)
