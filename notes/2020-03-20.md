## Pull request from Thibault

Thibault did a pull request based on this decision.

> Decision:  Do IIIF first, keep these other things in mind as we design a generic solution.

Pull request:

https://github.com/distributed-text-services/specifications/pull/177/commits/64933aded7a5cfc673db995e02eaaa33f120c8ba?short_path=b036c62#diff-b036c6205ccad2dd4573501db06fa0fa

1. Use normal Dublin Core for `dc:source` as an extensibility point in the catalog.

```
{
    "@context": {
        "@vocab": "https://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#",
        "dc": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/",
        "dts": "https://w3id.org/dts/api#",
        "sc": "http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2#"
    },
    "@id": "/a/collection/uri",
    "@type" : "Resource",
    "title" : "A title",
    "totalItems": 0,
    "dts:totalParents": 1,
    "dts:totalChildren": 0,
    "dts:passage": "/api/dts/documents?id=/a/collection/uri",
    "dts:references": "/api/dts/navigation?id=/a/collection/uri",
    "dts:citeDepth": 2,
    "dts:dublincore": {
        "dc:source": [
            {
                "@id": "https://a/manifest/uri",
                "@type": "sc:Manifest",
                "dc:title": "A manifest title"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

2. The same extensibility point works within an entry

```
{
    "@context": {
        "@vocab": "https://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#",
        "dc": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/",
        "dts": "https://w3id.org/dts/api#",
        "sc": "http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2#"
    },
    "@id":"/api/dts/navigation/?id=/a/text/id&level=2",
    "dts:citeDepth" : 2,
    "dts:level": 2,
    "member": [
      {"dts:ref": "ref 1"},
      {
        "dts:ref": "ref 2",
        "dts:dublincore": {
            "dc:source": [
                {
                    "@id": "https://a/manifest/uri",
                    "@type": "sc:Manifest",
                    "dc:title": "A manifest title"
                }
            ]
        }
      },
    ],
    "dts:passage": "/dts/api/documents/?id=/a/text/id{&ref}{&start}{&end}"
}
```

Hugh:  Is this always a source, or can it also be a relation (see also)?  You could, of course, have both. Does the answer to this question matter?

=> Add a NOTE saying you can use `dc:relation` too, and should if you think it is not a `dc:source`, etc.  We are not telling you how to use Dublin Core, we are telling you that you can.  Refer people to some DC reference.

Decision:  We approve the above pull request.

Thibault will wait for feedback from Hugh and Pietro on sc:range, etc. before merging.


=> Jonathan to draft a paragraph on extensibility points via Dublin Core,
`dts:extensions` (for vocabularies other than Dublin Core), perhaps in Entry.md, "General Information"?

=> Jonathan to ask Vincent to talk to IIIF and ask them to review this once it is merged into the document.

## Next meeting

=> Thibault, Hugh, Bridget, Ian, Jonathan to each propose at least entry for the cookbook

Jonathan:  I would like to be able to use other XML vocabularies, etc., for which there is no TEI equivalent.  Why not allow extensibility for any type via Dublin Core?

=> Jonathan can propose this, we will discuss in a later meeting.

Thibault: Are you talking about linking resources or creating resources the same way we have them in the document endpoint?
