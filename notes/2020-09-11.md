Action:  Hugh to ask TEI if they want to adopt DTS in some form - perhaps as a TEI SIG?

Things worth doing this year:

- Are we really Hydra compliant?  (Action: Jonathan to ask for Hydra review)
- IIIF-like approach to hide linked data, making it simpler (JSON-LD context)
- A page to try requests / responses - perhaps embedded in documentation.  Perhaps a dedicated element with a little metadata and some Javascript that understands it?

```
	<tryme url="asdfasdf" supported="POST" />
```

Queries?

- Clean house first
- Do queries when we have done that
