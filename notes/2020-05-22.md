OPEN.  Thibault created one entry, which illustrates IIIF.

We promise to shame people who do not provide something by the next meeting.

One issue per recipe.

## New Action Items

=>  Ian to prepare collections endpoint for discussion. Due for discussion at 5 June meeting.

Ian is working on expanding / revising the collections endpoint.

Collections and documents can have multiple parents.  There must be one overarching root in each collection.  A collection can exist with no members - in fact, this is the initial state of every collection before you start putting things into them.
