# Meeting Notes from 29 Aug 2016

## Next Meeting

* 3 October 2016 11:00 EDT/17:00 CEST

## Action Items

* Hugh to write up his model for the Papyri.info use case
* Everyone to try to prepare succinct statements of their requirements requirements for a Passage API 

## Discussion Notes

* Jeffrey reviewed the scta model
* Bridget reviewed the collections api model, in context of scta and cts
* General feedback seemed to be that the collections model approach might work, but we want to hold off until we can review Hugh's model
* Most are leaning towards need for a separate passage api (as there are distinctions that cannot be easily generalized in a collections model) but we need to understand the requirements better first
* If we go with the collections model, we need to get clarify on who defines capabilities like roles -- these could come in from DTS, the ontology, and/or be done on an ad-hoc basis
* Still need a way to model relationships between items in a collection (within an across levels of a collection hierarchy)
