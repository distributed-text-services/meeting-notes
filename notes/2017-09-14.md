Attendance:

- Bridget
- Hugh
- Thibault
- Jeffrey
- Vincent
- Matteo
- Jonathan

Decisions:

1. Adopt the Jonathan / Thibault proposals as the basis for our specification, modulo existing and future issues.
2. We will meet every 2 weeks.  We will try to complete the specification by the end of December.
3. Close Search Endpoint issue (https://github.com/distributed-text-services/distributed-text-services.github.io/issues/3) - we will have a separate endpoint for search.

Action Items:

- Action #1: Jonathan to move  the specification to GitHub as a standalone document (not just a Wiki entry) now that it is adopted.
- Action #2: Bridget to reorganize and consolidate the GitHub repos to simplify and reflect current specification structure.

Please let me know if I got any of this wrong.
