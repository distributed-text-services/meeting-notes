## New Action Items

## New Decisions

## Action Items (from last meeting)

* Thibault to update issue [#164](https://github.com/distributed-text-services/specifications/issues/164) with a proposal for 
how the range/capabilities metadata would be represented in the endpoints

Done.  Gold star. ðŸŒŸ

* All to review and comment on [IIIF](https://github.com/distributed-text-services/specifications/issues/162) and [versioning](https://github.com/distributed-text-services/specifications/issues/161) 
issues by the next meeting (25-Oct-2017)

No gold stars for us. They have requested that we provide guidelines for integrating DTS with an IIIF application.  To do this well, we probably need some use cases.  Need to specify the markup and how the two APIs would be used.

POSTPONE.  After Thanksgiving, Hugh, Jonathan, Matteo can look at this. Jonathan to instigate. ### meeting date ####

* All to review and comment on draft of [SWJ article](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQfREQtbLzfs6Hkya2QWnAfjOdpkClli3FuvSR4hxQY/edit). Article is due October 31. First drafts by October 21.

Done.

* Bridget to review Perseids implementation

Done.  Three new issues submitted as a result.  Three gold stars. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

* Thibault and Ian to implement items [124](https://github.com/distributed-text-services/specifications/issues/124) and [141](https://github.com/distributed-text-services/specifications/issues/141)

Thibault did this.  Another gold star.  Review namespace issue today.

## Discussion

# When do branches get merged?

Ian: When I went to make edits to my forked version of the repository, I realized that the upstream dev is behind the master branch, so if I make a pull request to the dev branch, how will this be handled?

Thibault: I am making my changes directly to the master branch.   I think we were waiting for modifications to CRUD before accepting this as a new feature. I have been doing bug fixes, which is why they are done on master.

Ian: Yes, I think it's a small fix. I will do it before the next meeting.

General strategy: Dev is used for new feature development.  We polish proposals there before committing to master.

# Issue 124 (see above)
https://github.com/distributed-text-services/specifications/issues/124

Closed.

# Issue 141

Closed and merged. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

# Issue 161 Versioning

We need use cases and clear thinking.  After Thanksgiving, Hugh, Jonathan, Matteo can look at this. Jonathan to instigate in order to have a more useful discussion at the first possible meeting after Thanksgiving.

## Next Meeting

25 October - main agenda item will be discussion of  [IIIF](https://github.com/distributed-text-services/specifications/issues/162) and [versioning](https://github.com/distributed-text-services/specifications/issues/161) 
issues by the next meeting (25-Oct-2017) with a goal of moving closer to a vote.

We should discuss this leftover issue:

* Issue 164
