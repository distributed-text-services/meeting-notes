## Discussion

Discussed Issue #186.  We currently have next, prev, up, and children in the document API.  The navigation API only allows you to go top to bottom and forward in the document.  That means that the document API has more full-featured navigation than the navigation API, which is suprising.   Within a document, we have a tree structure, not a generalized graph.

Jonathan thinks:

- The Navigation API should provide navigation to the parent(s) via a data property, just as we do for members
- In a document, there is only one parent.  In a collection, there can be several.
- In general, a document should use the graph subset of relationships in the collection API.  There is only one parent, but the same navigation directions should be supported.

Note that the document API already supports parents.

Hugh:

The parent of `/api/dts/navigation/?id=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.opp-grc&level=2&ref=3`
is the document.  Is the issue statement confused?


## Decisions

Insufficient quorum to decide.  We will discuss and prepare instead.
