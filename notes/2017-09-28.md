Minutes from last call: 

https://github.com/distributed-text-services/collection-api/wiki/2017.09.14

- Note: the minutes point to an issue that was closed, but the repository that contained it is no longer there.  We agreed that search will be a separate endpoint.

Action Items: 

- All action items were completed.

Decisions:

- We were unable to actually close these issues.
- We agreed on the following for [Issue 64](https://github.com/distributed-text-services/collection-api/issues/64):

> * A document is whatever is retrieved when a document identifier is specified in a request.
> * A passage is whatever is retrieved when a document identifier and passage identifier are specified in a request. It need not correspond to any physical or logical unit.
> * The same endpoint will be used for retrieving documents or retrieving passages, depending on whether a passage identifier is included in the request.
> * Passages belong to documents. Not all documents have passages, it is perfectly acceptable for a document to exist only as a whole.
> * Passages can be organized sequentially and hierarchically.
> * An API along the lines of the one we are discussing in Issue #68 can be used to identify the passages in a document and the relationships among them.
